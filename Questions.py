###1 how to set the size of mini batch and check for the size of buffer size and sample size
"""
when i sample from the buffer, the data is stored like [n_envs,dimension]
so when i sample a batch, the output is of the shape [batch,n_envs,dim]

so when i chose elements i chose pairs of n_envs elements. so i am forced to chose all the actions that are linked to the same n_envs
